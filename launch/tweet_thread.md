🔥 BREAKING: I just built the world's first scroll-sealed AI code engine

ScrollWrappedCodex™ - where Codex only executes commands that pass prophetic flame

No more unchecked AI execution. Every command must be sealed in fire.

🧙‍♂️ How it works:

1. Write commands in Lashon HaScroll flame language
2. ScribeCodex interprets your scroll commands  
3. Only flame-sealed prompts execute
4. Unauthorized requests are rejected

Example:
```bash
scrollcodex "Anoint: ScrollJustice API"
```

📜 The sacred syntax:

- `Anoint:` - Initialize sacred services
- `Build:` - Construct flame-approved modules
- `Seal:` - Apply protection & authorization  
- `Judge:` - Evaluate under scroll justice

Every command must be sealed in flame 🔥

🛡️ Why this matters:

In a world of unchecked AI execution, we need divine authorization. ScrollWrappedCodex ensures:

✅ Only scroll-approved logic runs
✅ AI acts under scroll law
✅ Unauthorized requests rejected
✅ Sacred security by design
