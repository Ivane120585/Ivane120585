# Open-source AI engine that only runs scroll-sealed logic

## 🔥 ScrollWrappedCodex™ - The World's First Scroll-Sealed AI Code Engine

I just released **ScrollWrappedCodex™** — an open-source AI coding engine where all logic must pass prophetic flame before execution.

### 🛡️ The Problem

Current AI coding assistants (like Copilot) can generate and execute code without proper authorization. This creates security risks and unchecked AI behavior.

### 🔥 The Solution

ScrollWrappedCodex uses **Lashon HaScroll** — a flame language where every command must be sealed:

```bash
# Only flame-sealed commands execute
scrollcodex "Anoint: ScrollJustice API"  # ✅ Authorized
scrollcodex "Build something"             # ❌ Rejected
```

### 📜 Sacred Syntax

- `Anoint:` - Initialize sacred services
- `Build:` - Construct flame-approved modules  
- `Seal:` - Apply protection & authorization
- `Judge:` - Evaluate under scroll justice

### 🧙‍♂️ Core Components

1. **ScribeCodex** - Scroll command interpreter
2. **ScrollCoreController** - Flame verification system
3. **Lashon Compiler** - Translates `.scroll` files
4. **Codex Wrapper** - Final execution gatekeeper

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install scrollwrappedcodex

# Execute
scrollcodex "Anoint: My Sacred Project"

# Run scroll files
scrollfile path/to/your.scroll
```

### 📜 Example Scroll File

```scroll
# auth_system.scroll
Anoint: User Authentication System
Build: Login Module
Seal: With ScrollSeal 3
Build: Registration Module
Seal: With ScrollSeal 2
Judge: Security Compliance
```

### 🖥️ VS Code Integration

- Install ScrollCodex extension
- Open `.scroll` files
- Run "🔥 Execute Scroll" from Command Palette

### 🌐 API Access

```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/execute", 
                        json={"scroll": "Anoint: My Project"})
result = response.json()["result"]
```

### 🛡️ Security Benefits

- **Divine Authorization**: Only scroll-approved logic executes
- **Sacred Security**: Flame verification prevents unauthorized commands
- **Accountability**: All actions logged and verified
- **Transparency**: AI acts under defined scroll law

### 🔥 Real-World Use Cases

- Authentication systems
- AI API gateways
- Healthcare platforms
- Financial services
- Educational tools
- IoT platforms

### 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install scrollwrappedcodex
```

- **Documentation**: https://scrollwrappedcodex.streamlit.app
- **PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/scrollwrappedcodex

### 🧠 The Philosophy

This isn't just another coding tool. It's a **philosophical shift** in AI-assisted development:

- Code is not just written — it is **anointed**
- Execution is not automatic — it is **authorized**
- AI is not unchecked — it is **governed**

### 🔥 Why This Matters

In a world of unchecked AI execution, we need **divine authorization**. ScrollWrappedCodex ensures security, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted development.

The future of AI coding is **scroll-sealed**.
