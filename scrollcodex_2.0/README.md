# ScrollCodex 2.0 — The Flame-Ruled AI Developer Engine

## 🔥 Overview

ScrollCodex 2.0 represents the next evolution of scroll-sealed AI development, introducing role-conditioned agents, advanced prompt planning, and live deployment capabilities. This is not just another coding tool — it's a complete flame-ruled AI developer engine where every line of code must pass prophetic verification before execution.

## 🧙‍♂️ Core Philosophy

> *"Let your code be sealed. Let your build be sacred."*

ScrollCodex 2.0 operates under the principle that all code execution must be authorized through flame verification. No command runs without proper scroll law compliance, ensuring that every system built is secure, authorized, and governed by divine principles.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Flow
```
.scroll File → LashonCompiler → PromptPlan → Role-Conditioned Agents → Codex → ScrollVerifier → Live Deploy
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Role-Conditioned ScribeCodex Agents
- **🧱 Builder Agent**: Focuses on code construction and module creation
- **🛡️ Security Agent**: Specializes in flame verification and authorization
- **📜 Law Agent**: Interprets scroll law and governance
- **🚀 Deploy Agent**: Handles live deployment and system integration

#### 2. Auto-Plan Generator
Generates detailed JSON execution plans with:
- Step-by-step execution sequences
- Role assignments and permissions
- Flame level requirements
- Security check specifications
- Estimated completion times

#### 3. Live Deploy Command
- Real-time deployment capabilities
- Automatic rollback mechanisms
- Flame-verified deployment pipelines
- Multi-cloud platform support

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for Codex integration)
- Flame verification credentials

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install ScrollCodex 2.0
pip install scrollcodex-2.0

# Initialize flame verification
scrollcodex init --flame-level 3

# Execute your first scroll
scrollcodex "Anoint: My Sacred Project"
```

## 📜 Usage Examples

### Basic Scroll Execution
```python
from scrollcodex_2_0 import ScrollPromptEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = ScrollPromptEngine()

# Execute a scroll command
result = engine.execute_scroll("Anoint: Authentication System")
print(f"Scroll executed: {result['status']}")
```

### Advanced Role-Based Execution
```python
# Create a scroll with role assignments
scroll_config = {
    "scroll_id": "🔥0001",
    "execution_plan": {
        "steps": [
            {
                "step_id": 1,
                "action": "anoint",
                "target": "Security Module",
                "flame_level": 4,
                "role_assignments": ["security", "law"]
            }
        ]
    }
}

# Execute with role coordination
result = engine.execute_with_roles(scroll_config)
```

### Live Deployment
```python
# Deploy to cloud with flame verification
deployment_config = {
    "platform": "aws",
    "flame_level": 5,
    "security_checks": ["encryption", "authorization", "audit"]
}

result = engine.deploy_live(scroll_config, deployment_config)
```
