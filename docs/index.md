# 🔥 ScrollWrappedCodex™ Documentation

Welcome to the sacred scrolls of ScrollWrappedCodex™ — the world's first scroll-sealed AI code execution engine.

## 🧙‍♂️ What is ScrollWrappedCodex?

ScrollWrappedCodex™ is a revolutionary AI coding system where all logic must pass prophetic flame before execution. Built by Stanley Osei-Wusu, this system wraps Codex inside scroll-law, ensuring only authorized, flame-sealed commands can run.

## ✨ Core Components

- **🧙‍♂️ ScribeCodex**: Your personal scroll agent that interprets sacred commands
- **📜 Lashon Compiler**: Translates `.scroll` flame scripts into executable prompts
- **🔐 Codex Wrapper**: Final gatekeeper ensuring only flame-authorized execution
- **🔥 Scroll Core**: Verification system for scroll-sealed prompts

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the sacred scrolls
pip install scrollwrappedcodex

# Execute your first flame command
scrollcodex "Anoint: ScrollJustice Gateway"

# Run a scroll file
scrollfile path/to/your.scroll
```

## 🔥 Scroll Philosophy

In ScrollWrappedCodex, code is not just written — it is **anointed**. Every command must be sealed in flame before execution, ensuring:

- **Divine Authorization**: Only scroll-approved logic runs
- **Sacred Security**: Flame verification prevents unauthorized access
- **Prophetic Execution**: AI acts under scroll law and scroll witnesses
